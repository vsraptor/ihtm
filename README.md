> This is still research project and I've done limited testing. Both the code and the Docs are work in progress. Keep this in mind. Plus I should be able to speed it up via numba once it is stable enough.

Currently I'm researching yet another approach, so the development of this project is postponed, but it is a good introductory framework and writing the documentation was a tedious process ;(. Even unfinished this can help many understand sparse vectors, HTM and other related technologies.

I hope you find it useful. Start at the TOC, github will render the docs for you.
