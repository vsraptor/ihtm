    "## **TM design**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first talk about the design of TM and see how the Segmented memory was born out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can see a schematic picture of part of a cortical/macro column (CC/MC). The columns in the image represent mini-columns. Every circle represent a neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "![htm](region.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the input SDP:SDR comes from the bottom, the outputs goes out from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that structure the process work like this :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fetch the next SDP from a source and then pass it to the columns (vertically)\n",
    "* For every column for which the SDP have value of 1 If a cell in the column is in **predictive** state, change the state to active\n",
    "* If there is no predicted cell in a column, change the state of all cells in this column to active (**bursting**)\n",
    "* Propagate the signal from all active cells laterally.\n",
    "* Decide which cells should switch to **predictive** state based on the lateral flow of information.\n",
    "* Rinse and repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplify, simplify, simplify\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the Cortical column (CC) by making a model of every neuron with segments and synapses, but this requires too many resources. So we have to simplify. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every neuron in a mini-column have the same feed-forward input plus there are also a myriad of lateral connections between the neurons within the CC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the common feed-forward, we can think of every mini-column as a **single CELL** with combined count of all the neurons distal segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a mini column is to detect patterns we do that by storing an SDP or thinned SDP's or union of SDP's into a \"segment\". Once stored we can compare the input data-SDP against those segments for a match. This mimics lateral neuron connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So to recap : A **CELL** can be implemented as 2D-array where every row represent a segment that store a iSDP or a UNION of iSDP's. And a CC can be implemented as a 3D array with a shape ( num-of-segments, num-of-mCols, nbits-per-iSDP ). \n",

    "### CC Capacity \n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that all of the CC neurons are used for the single purpose of memorizing TRANSITIONS  /this will make our calculations easier/.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do back of the envelope calculation :\n",
    "\n",
    "     mCol capacity = 100 mCol-neurons * 100 segments * 10 patterns-per-seg = 100 000 patterns\n",
    "     \n",
    "The number of CC in the cortex if we use 2000 bits SDP:SDR per CC is ~100 000, then :\n",
    "\n",
    "    CC capacity = patterns / sparsity = 100 000 / 0.02 = 5 Million transitions\n",
    "    \n",
    "the assumption is that to fill UNION with 2% sparse orthogonal SDP's, you need `1/0.02 = 50` of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cortex capacity = 5M * 100 000 CC = 500 Billion transitions\n",
